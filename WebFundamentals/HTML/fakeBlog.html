            <p>Kristopher Lee "Kris" Bryant (born January 4, 1992) is an American professional baseball third baseman and outfielder for the Chicago Cubs of Major League Baseball (MLB). Bryant attended the University of San Diego,[1] where he played college baseball for the Toreros, and won the Dick Howser Trophy and Golden Spikes Award his junior year in 2013. The Cubs selected him number-two overall in the 2013 MLB draft and he quickly became one of the top prospects in baseball. Bryant made his major league debut in 2015 and won the National League Rookie of the Year Award that year. He won a World Series championship with the Cubs in 2016 and was named the National League Most Valuable Player that same year.</p>
