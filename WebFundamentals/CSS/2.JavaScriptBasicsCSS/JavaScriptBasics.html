                <h3>JavaScript Baiscs</h3>
                <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. JavaScript is extrememly pois a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibilitypular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host enviroment (a web server or a node server, it can be connected to the objects of these enviroments to provide programmatic control over them. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="UnderLineBlue">Variable Declaration </span>JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup holds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are called identifiers. var x;
Variable Assignment Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x = 10;</span></li>
                    <li><span class="UnderLineBlue">Variable Assignment </span>Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span>var x = 10</span>;</li>
                    <li><span class="UnderLineBlue">Data Types </span>Data types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - <span>true</span> or <span>false;</span> null -<span>null</span>  aka nothing; Number - <span>42</span> or <span>3.14159</span>; String - <span>“Coding Dojo Rocks!</span>; Array - <span>[1, ‘Coding’, 2, ‘Dojo’]</span>; and Object - <span>{first_name: ’Jane, last_name: ‘Doe’}</span></li>
                    <li><span class="UnderLineBlue">Conditionals </span>When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. you can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. There are the following conditional statements: <span>if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span>else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first conditon is false; <span>else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
                    <li><span class="UnderLineBlue">Loops </span> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming language, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That’s a loop!</li>
                    <li><span class="UnderLineBlue">Function </span>Functions are an encapsulation of code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As anexample imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
