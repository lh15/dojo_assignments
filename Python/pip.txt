pip install Django  - I learned that this needs to be run outisde of the python enviroment

pip list - Got this message "DEPRECATION: The default format will switch to columns in the future. You can use --format=legacy        (or define a list_format in your pip.conf) to disable this warning.
    pip (9.0.0)
    setuptools (18.2)
    wheel (0.24.0)"
    I searched and found that this message is not an error but a  warning about an upcoming change.

pip install Django
    Requirement already satisfied: Django in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages
    Requirement already satisfied: pytz in /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages (from Django)

pip freeze - 
    pip list-
    List installed packages, including editables.
    pip freeze-
    Output installed packages in requirements format.
    So there are two differences:
    Output format, freeze gives us the standard requirement format that may be used later with pip install -r to install requirements from.
    Output content, pip list include editables which pip freeze does not.

Proceed (y/n)? y   
  Successfully uninstalled Django-1.11

pip show Django - 
    doesnt do anything. I guess bc it cant find the file

pip search flask - 
    Returns a list of every package with Flask in the name or description.
